                        <div class="text">
                            <p>
                                Protectionism is the economic policy of restricting imports from other countries
                                through methods such as tariffs on imported goods, import quotas, and a variety of
                                other government regulations. Proponents claim that protectionist policies shield the
                                producers, businesses, and workers of the import-competing sector in the country from
                                foreign competitors. However, they also reduce trade and adversely affect consumers in
                                general (by raising the cost of imported goods), and harm the producers and workers in
                                export sectors, both in the country implementing protectionist policies, and in the
                                countries protected against.

                                There is a consensus among economists that protectionism has a negative effect on
                                economic growth and economic welfare, while free trade, deregulation, and
                                the reduction of trade barriers has a positive effect on economic
                                growth. In fact protectionism has been implicated by some scholars as
                                the cause of some economic crises, in particular the Great Depression. However,
                                trade liberalization can sometimes result in large and unequally distributed losses and
                                gains, and can, in the short run, cause significant economic dislocation of workers in
                                import-competing sectors.

                        <h3>Free Trade</h3>
                        <div class="text">
                            <p>
                                Free trade is a trade policy that does not restrict imports or exports; it is the idea
                                of the free market as applied to international trade. In government, free trade is
                                predominately advocated by political parties that hold right-wing or liberal economic
                                positions, while economically left-wing political parties generally support
                                protectionism, the opposite of free trade.

                                Most nations are today members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) multilateral trade
                                agreements. Free trade is additionally exemplified by the European Economic Area and
                                the Mercosur, which have established open markets. However, most governments still
                                impose some protectionist policies that are intended to support local employment, such
                                as applying tariffs to imports or subsidies to exports. Governments may also restrict
                                free trade to limit exports of natural resources. Other barriers that may hinder trade
                                include import quotas, taxes, and non-tariff barriers, such as regulatory legislation.

                                There is a broad consensus among economists that protectionism has a negative effect on
                                economic growth and economic welfare, while free trade and the reduction of trade
                                barriers has a positive effect on economic growth. However,
                                liberalization of trade can cause significant and unequally distributed losses, and the
                                economic dislocation of workers in import-competing sectors.
